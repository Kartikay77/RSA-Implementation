# RSA-Implementation
# RSA Encryption & Decryption System 

This project implements the **RSA encryption and decryption algorithm** in Python.  
It provides a simple way to generate keys, encrypt plaintext, and decrypt ciphertext, demonstrating the fundamentals of public-key cryptography.  

---

##  Project Structure
- **rsa.py** → Core implementation of RSA (key generation, encryption, decryption).  
- **test.py** → Script to run and validate the RSA system with sample inputs.

---

## ⚙ Features
- Generates **public and private keys**.  
- Encrypts plaintext messages using the public key.  
- Decrypts ciphertext back to plaintext using the private key.  
- Demonstrates secure communication via asymmetric encryption.

##  How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rsa-encryption.git
   cd rsa-encryption
2. Run the test file:
   python test.py
3. You’ll see:
Generated RSA keys
Encrypted ciphertext
Decrypted plaintext

 Example Output

 Public Key: (e, n)
Private Key: (d, n)

Plaintext:  Hello RSA!
Encrypted:  30294820394823
Decrypted:  Hello RSA!

Background
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a widely used public-key cryptosystem for secure data transmission.
It works by generating two keys:
Public Key (for encryption, shared openly)
Private Key (for decryption, kept secret)
Security is based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.

Future Improvements
Add support for larger key sizes for stronger encryption.
Implement padding schemes (e.g., PKCS#1) for enhanced security.
Build a CLI or Web interface for user-friendly encryption/decryption.
